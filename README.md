The Re3gistry software is a reusable open-source solution for **managing and sharing ‘reference codes’** through persistent URIs, ensuring that concepts are unambiguously referenced in any domain.

> Reference codes can be sets of permissible values for a data field or to provide a reference or context for the data being exchanged between applications. Reference codes include enumerations, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri or, simply, ‘lists of things’.

Licensed under the **[EUPL](http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/eupl.html)**, Re3gistry is an open-source project that can be deployed and further developed by contributors from any sector; check out the Re3gistry Governance and contribution guidelines below.
A license copy is available in the repository's [LICENSE](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

### What Re3gistry offers you?

> The Re3gistry provides a central access point where labels and descriptions for reference codes are easily accessible by both humans and machines while fostering **semantic interoperability across organisations**.

Managing reference codes and setting up registries (systems of registers) helps:

* **Avoiding common mistakes** such as misspellings, entering synonyms, or filling out online forms.
* **Facilitating the internationalisation of user interfaces** by providing multilingual labels.
* **Ensuring semantic interoperability** when exchanging data between systems and applications.
* **Tracing changes over time** through a well-documented versioning system.
* **Increasing the value of the reference codes**, if widely reused and referenced

### Acknowledgements

> The development of the Re3gistry began in 2013 under the [Are3na action](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/are3na/about) (ISA Programme), continuing since 2016 under the [ELISE action](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/elise-european-location-interoperability-solutions-e-government/about) of the [ISA2 Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/isa2_en/). Starting in 2022, the **[Digital Europe Programme](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme)** is funding its development.

Version 2 of the software was developed with the [National Land Survey of Finland](https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en).

## Register Federation Tool

Within this repository, you will also find the [**Register-Federation-Tool**](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/tree/master/sources/Registry-Federation-Tool).

This tool allows you to **gather external records from third parties in one place**. It also allows you to search across subscribed registers and find extensibility relationships between them. The tool, therefore, takes advantage of the reuse of existing semantic resources, reducing data redundancy and avoiding copying errors.

> Register interconnection is possible by connecting registers that implement the ROR data exchange specification. Re3gistry produces this exchange format automatically between its export formats.

The European Commission Joint Research Center developed the Register Federation Tool as a testbed funded by the ISA Action 1.17 "ARE3NA" to test the feasibility of creating and declaring code list extensions that accommodate specific semantic needs while guaranteeing interoperability of the systems that use them.
Since then, the European Commission operated the INSPIRE federated registry until October 2024. It was used to publish extensions to the INSPIRE code lists used in national and thematic contexts. 

**This tool can be used in any domain that uses semantic assets, so it is freely distributed as an open source for anyone who needs to cover this gap.**

# Re3gistry governance and Contributions (Under development)

The Re3gistry project has established a governance model with well-defined processes to ensure the best use and sustainability of the software by the contributors and the community. The governance is overseen by the Re3gistry managers.

## Project boards

* **Improvement Proposal** (IP)
    * If you want to discuss an idea before documenting a full IP, create a new issue using the [IP template](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=re3gistry-improvement-proposal.md). Complete the template as much as possible and mention that this is not a complete proposal yet, but that you are looking for feedback. You will be asked to complete the proposal if the idea is supported.
   
* **Bug fixing**
    * If you would like to submit a bug report, please create a new issue in the Re3gistry repository using the [Bug report template](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=re3gistry-problem.md). The issue will be analysed and added to the bug fixing project board. If the development team needs more information, you might be contacted.
    * The project board will be updated whenever the status of an issue changes.
    * Pull requests for bug fixes are welcome (see more in "Contribution" below)!
