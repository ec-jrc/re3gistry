# Developer manual

## Scope

This manual is aimed at programmers wishing to customize or extend the Re3gistry software. Programmers wishing to extend or customize the Re3gistry software are expected to know and understand Java and object-oriented design principles. An understanding of HTML, JS and rest services is also required.

If you would like more information on how to use or install the software, please refer to the [User manual](user-manual.md) or the [Administrator manual](administrator-manual.md).

The following documentation provides information related to the module included in the Re3gistry software and its functionalities. Details of the classes and files for each module are commented directly "in line".

This is a live document continuously updated. To get the last version, you can refer to https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry.

Please report any issue or feedback on the documentation [in the issue tracker](https://github.com/ec-jrc/re3gistry/issues).

## Overview

The Re3gistry has been developed in a modular way. This means that the software is divided into modules that provide specific functionalities. The modules are described in the following sections.

Below is a summary of some technologies used to implement the software.

* Programming language: Java (1.8)
* Middle-ware: EclipseLink (tested with PostgreSQL)
* Authentication: Apache Shiro / EU Login
* Front-end languages and components:
  * HTML 5
  * jQuery 3.x
  * Bootstrap 4.x

### Initialisation of the project
Currently, NetBeans is the only IDE that can open and build this project correctly.

Because the library *ecas-tomcat-client*  is not available in any public maven repositories, it is included in the Re3gistry2Base module within the "dependencies" folder.
To initialise the local maven repository, the first step is to launch the maven "initialize" goal on the Re3gistry2Base project (&lt;package-root&gt;/sources/Re3gistry2Base).

## Software modules

The following sections describe each module and its functionalities. The details of each class can be found directly inline in the code.

### Re3gistry2 Base

This module contains all the common utilities to be used in the application. Examples of "utility" are the Mailing system, String functionalities, etc.

The Java sources contained in this module are subdivided into three different packages:

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.base.utility: containing all the common utilities, such as the string functions, string input sanitisers, authentication helper, configuration helper, etc.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.base.utility.exceptions: this package contains some custom exceptions implemented, for example, for the authentication system.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.base.utility.localization: this package contains the object and the managers handling the localization system.

### Re3gistry2 Model

This module contains the data model as Java Object. The Java Object model using Eclipse-link (JPA) reflects the database model.

The Java sources contained in this module are subdivided into three different packages:

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.model: this package contains all the Java objects representing the Database model.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.model.utility: this package contains the utilities managing, for example, the creation of the UUID and the model.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.model.uuidhandlers: this package contains all the classes that manage the creation of the uuid related to each specific object of the model.

### Re3gistry2 CRUD interface

The interfaces have been introduced to give the possibility to extend the application to many persistence layers. It defines all the methods that a driver for a specific persistence layer has to implement. An example could be to have an implementation for the Relational Databases, another for SPARQL, etc.

The Java sources contained in this module are subdivided into one package:

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.crudinterface: all the interfaces for the classes needed to access the persistence layer are available in this package.

### Re3gistry2 CRUD RDB

This module is the driver for the Relational Database persistence layer. It implements all the methods required by the related interface.

The Java sources contained in this module are subdivided into two different packages:

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.crudimplementation: here, all the managers are implementing the interfaces, providing access to the persistence system.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.crudimplementation.constants: this package contains the constants used by the above-mentioned classes

### Re3gistry2 Java API

The Java API modules handle the write logic and operations (create, update, delete) to the system, using the driver implemented (in this case, the Re3gistry CRUD rdb).

The Java sources contained in this module are subdivided into three different packages:

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.javaapi.handler: this package contains the classes that provide the Java APIs for most of the actions available on the system.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.javaapi.handler.action: this package contains the classes handling automatic actions, like the bulk import.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.javaapi.solr: the handler of the actions to store the data in the Solr engine is available in this package.

### Re3gistry2 Migration

The migration module takes and migrates the data from the old data model to the new model. At the system's installation, the user is asked to choose between having a clean system installation or importing all the available data from an older software version.

The Java sources contained in this module are subdivided into four different packages:

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.migration.handler: this package contains some utilities that manage the installation and migration system steps.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.migration.manager: this package contains the manager performing the actions needed to migrate the data from the old database model to the new one.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.migration.migrationmodel: this package contains the model related to the database of the old version of the Re3gistry software.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.migration.utility: this package contains the utility the migration system uses, like the constants, the tools to calculate the statistics of the items to be migrated, etc.

### Re3gistry2 REST API

This module provides APIs to access the registry's data in different formats and languages.

This is a web application that exposes the RESTful APIs to the web.
The Java sources contained in this module are subdivided into four different packages:

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.restapi: this package contains the core of the API system
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.restapi.cache: this package handles the cache for the API
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.restapi.format: this package contains the java classes that provide a specific data format. If there is a need for a new format, a new class that is handling the required format should be created here.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.restapi.util: this package contains the different utilities used by the API system.

### Re3gistry2 Service Web-app

This is the web app to provide the service front-end. The web app is developed in HTML 5, using Bootstrap 4.x as UI library.

All the JSPs, representing the "view" layer, have their respective "control layer" in the source packages.

The web services for the UI, used directly in the web pages by Ajax calls, are available in the "jsp/ajaxServices" folder. This JSP exposes the JSON encoding; the related controller provides the data in the sources section.

The JavaScript configuration is read from the application's configuration files and exposed through a dynamic JS provided by a JSP contained in the folder "jsp/dynamicJs".

Some common files reused in different JSPs, such as the Header and the footer, are collected in the "jsp/includes" folder.

* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.web.controller: this package contains all the content related to the web application's JSP.
* eu.europa.ec.re3gistry2.web.utility.jsp: this package contains the utilities used in the JSP pages, such as common HTML pieces calculated based on some parameters or some checks done at the JSP level.

### Re3gistry2 build helper

The Re3gistry2-build-helper module is a helper for the build operation (it allows the launch of the build operation in just one place instead of building each module one by one).
In the pom.xml of this module, you can find 2 example profiles, one for local development and one for server deployment. 

**Notes**
Some of these modules are depending ones by others. You can check all the structures and dependencies by looking at the pom.xml file.

### How to customise GitHub to use your own files

Please check the folder "dist\customize-interface\example-profile-developer". Here, you will find a script to be run after customising your own paths to your local repository of the project and your customised files: such as the footer, header, and configurations. Once the script has copied all the files into your repository, you can start using the system already containing your customised interface.

### Configuration Apache SHIRO
The Apache SHIRO configuration is defined in `source\Re3gistry2\src\main\resources\shiro.ini` and `sources\Re3gistry2\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\web.xml`.

Add to your profile 

     <application.login.provider>SHIRO</application.login.provider>

Restart the service and check the authentication mechanism.

### Configuration EU Login
EU Login is the central login mechanism of the European Commission. You can enable login against that central service if your intended users have or can acquire an EU Login.

The EU Login configuration is defined in
`sources\Re3gistry2\src\main\resources\ecas-config.properties` and `sources\Re3gistry2\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\web.xml`.

Add to your profile: 

     <application.login.provider>ECAS</application.login.provider>
     <ecas.filter.serverName>CHANGE_ME_SERVER_NAME</ecas.filter.serverName>
     <ecas.filter.serverPort>CHANGE_ME_PORT</ecas.filter.serverPort>
     <ecas.filter.serverContextPath>CHANGE_ME_CONTEXT_APPLICATION</ecas.filter.serverContextPath>

For tomcat, add two files to the Tomcat lib folder: ecas-tomcat-x.y.z.jar and log4j-x.y.z.jar. 

Verify that the JDK trusts the [ECAS certificates](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/confluence/display/IAM/Downloads-Certificates) else import them on the keystore of the JVM.
Restart the service and check the authentication mechanism.

## Updating the URLs for Page Icons (Favicons) and Images

To modify the URL where the page icons (favicons) and images point, navigate to the following path: `sources\Re3gistry2\src\main\resources\configurations_files\configuration.properties.` Within this file, locate the property **web.cdn_url** . This property serves as the base URL for your icons and images and can be adjusted according to your requirements.

Once you've made changes to the **web.cdn_url** property, it will be used in `sources\Re3gistry2\src\main\webapp\jsp\includes\head.inc.jsp` to generate the final URLs for the page icons and images, enabling you to customize their paths as necessary.

## Webapp Icons
By default, the site header logo image is configured to display a different picture for each language. When you change the language using the language selector, the logo will automatically update to match the selected language.

![Site HeaderLogo](images/site-header-logo.png)

If you prefer to use a single logo for all languages, you can modify the configuration file located at `dist/webapp/public_html/conf/conf.js` Set the **registryApp.multiLogo** variable to false. Below this variable, you will find **registryApp.singleLogoPath**, where you should specify the path to the single logo.
