This page informs about the release strategy for the Re3gistry software and the Register Federation Tool. It aims at clarifying the release planning process openly and transparently to the community.

## The release plan in a nutshell

The annual release plan comprises:
There is a single annual release:
* A **major annual release** of the Re3gistry software is expected by the **end of June**, including major developments and bug fixes.
* The Re3gistry major release is followed **two months later** by the **Register Federation Tool standalone major release**. 
* In addition to these major releases, at least **two other minor releases** are expected for each tool throughout each year.

###  Re3gistry software:

- **Major releases**: June 2022, June 2023, June 2024
- **Minor releases**: Every three months between major releases. December, March, September.

###  Register Federation Tool:

- **Major releases**: November 2022, November 2023, November 2024
- **Minor releases** every three months between major releases. February, May, August.

**Notes**: 
* All the **_breaking changes_**, which imply important application modifications, are only included in the major versions. In contrast, the **_non-breaking changes_** are included in any version (major or minor). 
* **_Hotfixes_**, fixes to major bugs or faults, are released as quickly as possible, even creating a new minor release outside the roadmap.

## Release plan calendar
Issues are assigned specific milestones to inform users which issues will be included in each release.
